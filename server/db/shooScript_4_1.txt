claire: GARY WHAT DID YOU SAY??

lines: 

what, indeed, did gary say, wondered the viewer. &nbsp;

--------------------------
1.

incoming: 

claire: About what, Gary. &nbsp;What is he out of his depth about?
claire: what are you guys talking about?
claire: WHAT!!?!

lines: 

what are any of us talking about. A question not easily answered, to be certain

--------------------------
2.

incoming: 

claire: good things about what, Gary?
gary: I ONLY SAID GOOD THINGS!!!

lines: 

good and sensual and generous things, dear Claire

--------------------------
3.

incoming: 

dan: Gary totally ruined your chances of getting that job!

lines: 

The betrayal is revealed. &nbsp;a pox on both your houses

--------------------------
4.

incoming: 

gary: I DIDN'T TELL THEM THAT SHE WAS A STRIPPER

lines: 

A desperate claim, surely not enough to sway the jury at this stage

--------------------------
5.

incoming: 

gary: Oh for god's sake. I. NEVER. SAID. SHE. WAS. A STRIPPER
gary: That's just not true! &nbsp;I helped her chances

lines: 

The defendant nervously shift in his seat as he fights back accusations

--------------------------
6.

incoming: 

dan: He told them you used to be a stripper!
dan: OH YEAH?? &nbsp;BY TELLING THEM THAT SHE USED TO BE A STRIPPER?
dan: ummm... GARY TOLD THEM YOUR WERE A STRIPPER!

lines: 

the betrayal is multiplied! &nbsp;surely there is no coming back from this revelation

--------------------------
7.

incoming: 

dan: GARY TELL ME YOU DIDN'T MAKE CLAIRE STRIP FOR YOU AT YOUR BACHELOR PARTY!
claire: NO! .....&nbsp;welll... &nbsp;not&nbsp;exactly, I was more of a lesso..... THAT'S NOT THE POINT
claire: Dan! &nbsp;Gary didn't do anything. Relax
dan: Gary, what did you do. &nbsp;What did you do at the bachelor party
claire: ohhhh Gary. &nbsp;You didn't tell them about your bachelor party gift.
gary: I didn't do anything
dan: well then what happened??

lines: 

but...&nbsp;wait... did you actually strip for Gary?

--------------------------
8.

incoming: 

claire: YOU TOLD THEM I WAS A STRIPPER??!?

lines: 

The first flurry of arrows shiver through the air from the 3rd army. The battle has officially begun!

--------------------------
9.

incoming: 

claire: PLEASE SAY YOU DIDN'T TELL THEM THAT GARY!!!!
gary: I told them a story that clearly showed how great, willing and generous of a friend you are. &nbsp;And... It was the story of my bachelor party

lines: 

hold on hold on hold on, I wasn't there. Did you actually do it?

--------------------------
10.

incoming: 

gary: I DIDN'T TELL THEM YOU WERE A STRIPPER! I told them you were a great gift giver

lines: 

an awkward defense to be sure

--------------------------
11.

incoming: 

claire: I DIDN'T STRIP AT HIS F*(^*ING BACHELOR PARTY!!... &nbsp;ahem. &nbsp;I showed the stripper some moves so Gary could have a better time.... and Gary happened to walk in in the middle of my tutorial
gary: oh shit.
claire: I kind of... taught a stripper some dance moves.. at Gary's bachelor party... and he was there

lines: 

&lt;momentarily speechless&gt;&nbsp;If you'll excuse me gentleman, I must retire to the lavatory

--------------------------
12.

incoming: 

gary: Dan is totally out of his depth right now and about to get us all in a fight
dan: I'm not out of my depth, bro! &nbsp;You told the place she interviewed at that&nbsp;she strips for dollar bills and she would do it there too!!

lines: 

A depth too deep for anyone to yet understand

And a depth too deep for... oh wait I just said that. &nbsp;Did I just say that?

ending: Hey alright! &nbsp;A blooper made it to the final piece

--------------------------
13.

incoming: 

gary: I got the job reference call today

lines: 

A call from the heavens. &nbsp;Should we hire her? said god. &nbsp;No, said Gary.

--------------------------
14.

incoming: 

claire: NOT IN A BAD WAY?! &nbsp;YOU BROUGHT UP WHAT WE DID AT YOUR BACHELOR PARTY TO MY POTENTIAL EMPLOYER! &nbsp;THERE IS NO WAY 'NOT IN A BAD WAY'

lines: 

some actions are far to devious to find light in them. &nbsp;Gary has found himself in a corner

--------------------------
15.

incoming: 

dan: this should be good
gary: WELL IF YOU GIVE ME A CHANCE I CAN TELL YOU!
claire: Go ahead

lines: 

The group eagerly awaited

and as it waited the most &lt;text tone&gt; wtf.... this isn't my phone... OH NO!

ending: Nick does an awful lot of business on his phone. &nbsp;Just food for thought

--------------------------
16.

incoming: 

dan: Claire if it's any consolation I think you're pretty enough to be one.
gary: Uh oh

lines: 

an emotional twist! the audience is thrown off!

--------------------------
17.

incoming: 

gary: uh oh
dan: WHAT DO YOU MEAN DON'T BE WEIRD?! &nbsp;TAKE A COMPLIMENT
claire: Dan don't be weird

lines: 

a weak advance easily paried!

--------------------------
18.

incoming: 

claire: uh. &nbsp;ok Dan. Anyway...
dan: Fine Gary. &nbsp;What did you say?
gary: Yeah. anyway..... I didn't tell them you were a stripper

lines: 

Popcorn munches echo through the audience

--------------------------
19.

incoming: 

claire: whoa whoa, why are you so upset?
dan: how could you do this to me man.. &nbsp;HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?!

lines: 

The final punch is thrown. &nbsp;It's a knockout blow!

--------------------------
20.

incoming: 

dan: DON'T TELL ME TO COOL OFF AFTER YOU F(*&amp;*ING SLEPT WITH&nbsp;THE GIRL YOU KNOW I'M IN LOVE WTH

lines: 

DIAAAAMMMNN

ending: Whoops, Dan. &nbsp;I don't think you were ready to say that

--------------------------
21.

incoming: 

gary: Claire didn't do anything. &nbsp;In reality, I had the most embarrassing time at my bachelor party
claire: AHAHAHAHAHA... &nbsp;I TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT THAT!
gary: Dan, just cool off man.&nbsp;
dan: what the hell are you talking about now?

lines: 

a flurry from the corner. &nbsp;could this be a comeback?!

--------------------------
22.

incoming: 

dan: HAHAH... NEEEEVVEERRRMIIIINNDDD. &nbsp;anyways, gary's a dick, right?

lines: 

a flimsy misdirect

--------------------------
23.

incoming: 

dan: <b>I can't believe you said that, man</b>
gary: I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING LIKE THAT!! &nbsp;If anything, I helped her chances of getting the job
claire: what are you guys talking about?

lines: 

A disturbing twist in the lives of 4 friends

the audience sits on the edge of their seat in anticipation of an explosion

Will they avoid... &lt;phone rings, nick picks it up&gt; oh shit hold on a minute. 'What up girlie??'

ending: Nick had been a friend to the group for many years, though they couldn't say they knew him much better than the first day they had met him. &nbsp;What were these alternate lives he lived?

--------------------------
24.

incoming: 

gary: I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING LIKE THAT!! &nbsp;If anything, I helped her chances of getting the job

lines: 

A bold claim in defense. &nbsp;Knight takes pawn

What will the oppositions' next move be?

Will they avoid... &lt;phone rings, nick picks it up&gt; oh shit hold on a minute. 'What up girlie??'

ending: Nick had been a friend to the group for many years, though they couldn't say they knew him much better than the first day they had met him. &nbsp;What were these alternate lives he lived?

--------------------------
25.

incoming: 

gary: There's a reason Claire put me down as her reference and not you, Dan
dan: it's because you asked her to?
claire: It's because he asked me to

lines: 

The audience stops for a moment to consider, and quickly realizes he probably asked her to

The disturbing painting&nbsp;of Gary is&nbsp;taking recognizable form with each brush stroke

Like a dark night terror, the face of dear Gary began to morph into &lt;phone rings&gt; &nbsp;oh crap hold on 'bueno? &nbsp;NO TE IMPORTAS, PUTO! &nbsp;Y NUNCA HABLAR A MI ESA MANERA&nbsp;<br>

ending: the darkness Nick was weaving into charming narrative just a moment ago began to form in a cloud around him. &nbsp;Who was he, actually?

--------------------------
26.

incoming: 

dan: And you're a narcissist. AND you're not as smart as you think you are&nbsp;

lines: 

oooooohhhhhhhhh

The tale of Gary and Dan, an unlikely star crossed romance, the likes.. &lt;phone rings&gt; oh hold on

ending: This ending was used to cap&nbsp;multiple dialog threads, so all I can really say is I'm sorry for the laziness

--------------------------
27.

incoming: 

dan: no Gary. &nbsp;You took a big fat steaming crap on her chances

lines: 

unexpected and&nbsp;disturbing imagery wafts into space between them

You, the viewer, must now live with that waking nightmare every time you close your eyes.

A graphic&nbsp;concept too terrible to.. &lt;phone rings&gt; &nbsp;oh hold on 'yes? &nbsp;yes sir.&nbsp; yes sergeant I'll be right there. &nbsp;Gotta go guys sorry'

ending: Indeed our new&nbsp;understanding of Nick seems to be drifting further and further from what we thought to be true

--------------------------
28.

incoming: 

gary: Shut up Nick

lines: 

Our antagonist&nbsp;turns to the camera and jeers at the audience

Like a dark night terror, the face of dear Gary began to morph into &lt;phone rings&gt; &nbsp;oh crap hold on 'bueno? &nbsp;NO TE IMPORTAS, PUTO! &nbsp;Y NUNCA HABLAR A MI ESA MANERA&nbsp;<br>

ending: the darkness Nick was weaving into charming narrative just a moment ago began to form in a cloud around him. &nbsp;Who was he, actually?

--------------------------
29.

incoming: 

dan: hahaha. &nbsp;Maybe Nick brings up a good point. Maybe Gary is some sort of a dark character in a psychological thriller
claire: Nick you're not helping
gary: Shut up Nick

lines: 

The entire troupe begins to pick up vegetables from&nbsp;the stage and sling them&nbsp;back out into the maddening audience

--------------------------
30.

incoming: 

claire: DAN! &nbsp;Stop piling on Gary

lines: 

A noble defense from his &lt;phone rings&gt; oh hold on 'waaaaaazzzzzzzuuuuuuuuuhhhhh'

ending: I don't really have much to say about this ending. &nbsp;it's definitely not the most interesting one

--------------------------
31.

incoming: 

gary: Alright, you know what, Dan? &nbsp;If you're jealous, that's fine
gary: It's because she thinks highly of my opinion
gary: And you're a very jealous person, also

lines: 

Watch as the animal stands tall and&nbsp;puffs it's fur when it's cornered

The tale of Gary and Dan, an unlikely star crossed romance, the likes.. &lt;phone rings&gt; oh hold on

ending: This ending was used to cap&nbsp;multiple dialog threads, so all I can really say is I'm sorry for the laziness

--------------------------
32.

incoming: 

dan: SHUT UP, NICK!
gary: NICK SHUT UP!
claire: NICK&nbsp;PLEASE&nbsp;STOP!

lines: 

.... I.... FINE! &nbsp;boring pieces of sh..

ending: A totally curbed conversation. How easy it is to run interference

--------------------------
33.

incoming: 

dan: ....Did you drug her?
dan: oh wait no. &nbsp;it's because you physically threatened her
gary: I didn't ask her to!
dan: you.... blackmailed her?
dan: Gary.... There are no bounds to your delusions

lines: 

The conversation twisted and turned into the thickening brambles&nbsp;

The tale of Gary and Dan, an unlikely star crossed romance, the likes.. &lt;phone rings&gt; oh hold on

ending: This ending was used to cap&nbsp;multiple dialog threads, so all I can really say is I'm sorry for the laziness

--------------------------
34.

incoming: 

claire: Ohhh Gary... I think you're very nice, but that's not why
claire: For you, that's like getting on your knees and kissing my toes
claire: FOR A NORMAL PERSON! &nbsp;But for you that was like falling to the ground and kissing my toes
claire: It was very sweet, &nbsp;in a Gary sort of way..
claire: Sure you did. Two weeks&nbsp;ago at Thirsty Crow, You said 'It would be a mistake to not put me down as a reference'&nbsp;

lines: 

Ahhh, the charming insult. Claire had grown skilled in this

But the area where her skill had grown the most&nbsp;was sitting.. &lt;text tone&gt; &lt;looks at phone and leaves&gt;

ending: Have you noticed how infrequently the group addresses Nick. &nbsp;It's almost like he's the real audience

--------------------------
35.

incoming: 

gary: That&nbsp;hardly sounds like&nbsp;asking
gary: It sounds more like just good solid advice

lines: 

Did he really believe this even at the moment it left his&nbsp;&lt;phone rings&gt; hold on &lt;dork voice&gt; HAAAALLLLLOOOOO? &nbsp;SOWRRRYY WRAWNG NUMBER

ending: I have a question for you, friendly viewer. &nbsp;Are we sure any of these characters aren't a fabrication of Nick's imagination? &nbsp;Could he be simply playing with action figures?

--------------------------
36.

incoming: 

claire: F*&amp;^K YOU NICK, YOU F*&amp;^ING THEATER NERD. &nbsp;Start talking to people instead of being their audience. &nbsp;Stop your course down the road to becoming a serial killer

lines: 

&lt;speechless&gt;

ending: Quick question viewer. &nbsp;Do you think I'm the voice inside your head? &nbsp;Or am I just an impartial abstract narrator being?... oorrrrrr, am I Nick in the future, telling stories from across the glass in jail...

--------------------------
37.

incoming: 

dan: Gary, I know the default is creepy and pretentious, but could you at least act until my stomach settles down?
dan: Classic Gary

lines: 

Classic Gary, Dan and Claire.&nbsp;though they fought, these were the days that. &lt;text tone&gt; &lt;looks at phone&gt; &nbsp;'MOTHERF(*&amp;^ER!' &nbsp;runs upstairs

ending: A warning from a fellow secret agent? An alert from his smart fridge app telling him the milk is getting low? &nbsp;Who can really know

--------------------------
38.

incoming: 

dan: Claire's&nbsp;not going to get that job because of you

lines: 

The betrayal is revealed! 4 houses nervously shift waiting to see how alliances stand

the audience sits on the edge of their seat in anticipation of an explosion

Will they avoid... &lt;phone rings, nick picks it up&gt; oh shit hold on a minute. 'What up girlie??'

ending: Nick had been a friend to the group for many years, though they couldn't say they knew him much better than the first day they had met him. &nbsp;What were these alternate lives he lived?

--------------------------
39.

incoming: 

claire: Oh my god!&nbsp;How will I ever survive!? &nbsp;Relax Dan
dan: She'll end up spiraling into an labyrinth of depression!
gary: OK, what am I missing here? Claire, are you prevented, by law, from applying for any other job except for this one?
claire: I am prevented by my gender from applying for more than 2 jobs in a calendar year. It's a real raw deal

lines: 

Surely an implication he didn't intend. Or does this bring up deeper questions on Dan's world views?

as Dan passed through the gates now outside of the realm of accepted sani..&lt;text message tone&gt; Guys it appears that we have a spy &lt;pulls out a knife and lunges at the 360 camera&gt;

ending: That was the last anybody had a notion of you before you passed into the afterlife, dear viewer. &nbsp;Now you realize that we are going through&nbsp;this exercise to explore the spectrum of possible outcomes of what turned out to be the last moments of your life

--------------------------
40.

incoming: 

claire: Nick, you're not going to do this the whole night again, are you?

lines: 

The lady doth protest too much me thinks

--------------------------
41.

incoming: 

claire: that... that phrase, it doesn't apply.. do you even know what it means??

lines: 

ever the silent critic,&nbsp;Claire finally speaks up. She is woman, hear her roar

--------------------------
42.

incoming: 

gary: ok. first of all,&nbsp;why in the world would I do something like that on purpose?

lines: 

A miscalculated defense. Surely many answers come to mind

The arrows are now steadily sailing over the wall, any one of them could find their mark if Gary isn't careful

Soon now, we'll see the.. &lt;text tone&gt; oh hold on. &nbsp;F*&amp;^% YOU. &nbsp;NO F*&amp;^% YOU.... &nbsp;NO... no... fine... fine... ok I'm sorry too. &nbsp;Love you mom

ending: I don't know how many you've watched so far, but this is in the running for Most&nbsp;Normal Nick Moment.

--------------------------
43.

incoming: 

gary: and second of all, NO. &nbsp;I didn't mess anything up. &nbsp;I was perfect on the phone

lines: 

beads of sweat form above his upper lip. &nbsp;The jury grew more alert with each implausible claim and nervous shift

At this point, Gary had committed to much to this angle to back &lt;phone rings&gt; hold on. &nbsp;&lt;takes a moment to collect himself&gt; 'RAINBOWS SPLASH ALL AROUND US, HOPE YOU'RE HAVING A SPECIAL DAY!!'

ending: I suppose the most important question to raise at this very confusing moment, is what did Nick do with the original guy?

--------------------------
44.

incoming: 

dan: and, Gary...&nbsp;&nbsp;that stupid grin on your face right now.., &nbsp;MAKES ME KNOW YOUR DID IT ON PURPOSE!

lines: 

Indeed, the expression on his does express a certain demonic quality

--------------------------
45.

incoming: 

claire: Oh god Gary, did you call out Dan&nbsp;about the mess in the shower?
gary: &lt;whispers&gt;&nbsp;oh no, Claire don't do it
dan: &lt;nervous laugh&gt;&nbsp;hahah... what?

lines: 

&lt;breaks narrative character&gt; &nbsp;WAIT THAT WAS NICK?&nbsp;I thought Gary said his nephew got sick in the bathtub??

... oh god I got my foot in i.&lt;text tone&gt; hold on... 'MOTHERF^%*^%&amp;*!!' &nbsp;&lt;runs upstairs&gt;

ending: I don't know what number playthrough this is for you, viewer, but it's starting to become clear to me that Nick is very likely an extremely dangerous person

--------------------------
46.

incoming: 

gary: Let's change the subect back to me! &nbsp;Aren't I a tactless dick?! Let's get back to our other argument

lines: 

no no. &nbsp;We aren't changing off of this one.. wait. wait wait. &nbsp;THE POOP SPLATTER&nbsp;WAS FROM NICK?!

... oh god I got my foot in i.&lt;text tone&gt; hold on... 'MOTHERF^%*^%&amp;*!!' &nbsp;&lt;runs upstairs&gt;

ending: I don't know what number playthrough this is for you, viewer, but it's starting to become clear to me that Nick is very likely an extremely dangerous person

--------------------------
47.

incoming: 

claire: Gary... please tell me you didn't tell them about my arrest

lines: 

bahahahah

ending: Oh Claire. &nbsp;They don't know what you did, but I do. &nbsp;Naughty girl....

--------------------------
48.

incoming: 

dan: OK, Nick. Two can play at this game. &nbsp;'The strangest among them was so bored by their mindless quibbling, that he began to construct super structures of story to lay over their otherwise laborious common worries.'
claire: He began to think of the people he interacted with more like action figures than people

lines: 

...what are you doing?

you think you understand me?

&lt;freaking out&gt; YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. &nbsp;YOU DON'T KNOW WHO I AM. YOU'VE NEVER KNOWN ME!!

ending: All of those point rung true, which made this path in the conversation truly sadder

--------------------------
49.

incoming: 

gary: hahah. &nbsp;I get it. &nbsp; 'But the more he weaved his own intricate latice work to lay upon the concrete reality, the less he could tell the difference between the two'

lines: 

STOP!

you think you understand me?

&lt;freaking out&gt; YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. &nbsp;YOU DON'T KNOW WHO I AM. YOU'VE NEVER KNOWN ME!!

ending: All of those point rung true, which made this path in the conversation truly sadder

--------------------------
50.

incoming: 

gary: by the way, thanks for ghosting my bachelor party,&nbsp;assholes.
dan: ... sorry about that&nbsp;dude
claire: it was pretty weird you two&nbsp;weren't there

lines: 

oh.. uuhhhh. &nbsp;yeah

Well listen. &nbsp;All joking aside, Gary I think we all owe you an apology. &nbsp;This entire argument has been targetting you, and it sounds like you didn't deserve it at all

ending: An unexpected lucid moment from Nick to bring us all needed closure. &nbsp;Or needed beginning. Depends on how many times you've viewed this

I'm really sorry I missed it, Gary

ending: And so dear friends, whether you've found this first, or after a few tries, or after hundreds... you've finally reached the sweetest end to our tale.. &nbsp;But I supposed I don't know if this is actually the sweetest.. or the end.

incoming: 

gary: Me and the interviewer got along great. &nbsp;I told them how driven and qualified you are and even got into a funny story that I think showed you from a different angle.
gary: That's just not true! &nbsp;I helped her chances

lines: 

OH YEAH?? &nbsp;BY TELLING THEM THAT SHE USED TO BE A STRIPPER?

Claire if it's any consolation I think you're pretty enough to be one.

HAHAH... NEEEEVVEERRRMIIIINNDDD. &nbsp;anyways, gary's a dick, right?

You know what. nevermind.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm getting tired of this. &nbsp;Claire I was trying to stick up for you

lines: 

<b>I can't believe you said that, man</b>

Claire's&nbsp;not going to get that job because of you

She'll end up spiraling into an labyrinth of depression!

SHE'LL END UP LIVIN ON THE STREETS, HOOKIN AND DOIN DRUGS!

ending: Dan quickly spiraled out of control as he tends to do. &nbsp;Hey viewer. Why not try listening to the other roommates&nbsp;a bit on the next go round, hunh?

--------------------------
10.

incoming: 

nick: the audience sits on the edge of their seat in anticipation of an explosion

Gary totally ruined your chances of getting that job!

no Gary. &nbsp;You took a big fat steaming crap on her chances

He told them you used to be a stripper!

Claire if it's any consolation I think you're pretty enough to be one.

HAHAH... NEEEEVVEERRRMIIIINNDDD. &nbsp;anyways, gary's a dick, right?

You know what. nevermind.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm getting tired of this. &nbsp;Claire I was trying to stick up for you

incoming: 

gary: There's a reason Claire put me down as her reference and not you, Dan
claire: It's because he asked me to
nick: The audience stops for a moment to consider, and quickly realizes he probably asked her to

lines: 

it's because you asked her to?

oh wait no. &nbsp;it's because you physically threatened her

....Did you drug her?

If you want to know the real reason it's because she feels sorry for you,&nbsp;Gary

incoming: 

claire: Nick you're not helping
nick: Our antagonist&nbsp;turns to the camera and jeers at the audience
gary: Shut up Nick
nick: The disturbing painting&nbsp;of Gary is&nbsp;taking recognizable form with each brush stroke

lines: 

hahaha. &nbsp;Maybe Nick brings up a good point. Maybe Gary is some sort of a dark character in a psychological thriller

eh nevermind. &nbsp;Gary, even with your most tactless pompousness you couldn't scuff the shine coming off Claire, so maybe I don't care that your told her future boss she used to be a stripper

ending: A moment of forgiveness for Dan. &nbsp;A string of misunderstanding for Gary. What a strange and delicate balance to keep our friendships upright

--------------------------
17.

gary: Alright, you know what, Dan? &nbsp;If you're jealous, that's fine

SHUT UP, NICK!

19.

incoming: 

gary: I think i know what it is. &nbsp;It's embarrassing to say, but I think Dan is in love with me

lines: 

&lt;speechless&gt;

ending: That last part didn't really seem related to anything. &nbsp;I fear this portion of the writing happened later into the evening

--------------------------
20.

incoming: 

claire: Ohhh Gary... I think you're very nice, but that's not why
claire: For you, that's like getting on your knees and kissing my toes
claire: FOR A NORMAL PERSON! &nbsp;But for you that was like falling to the ground and kissing my toes
gary: That&nbsp;hardly sounds like&nbsp;asking

nick: Surely an implication he didn't intend. Or does this bring up deeper questions on Dan's world views?

lines: 

Nick shut up

that's not what I mean!&nbsp;&nbsp;I just know this job was really important to you and Gary fucked everything up

and, Gary...&nbsp;&nbsp;that stupid grin on your face right now.., &nbsp;MAKES ME KNOW YOUR DID IT ON PURPOSE!

YOU DID IT ON PURPOSE BECAUSE YOU KNOW&nbsp;I LOVE HER MAN.. i mean.... uhh.. I...&nbsp; is someone at the door? &lt;runs upstairs&gt;

ending: It seems the years of building&nbsp;pressure in Dan had finally cracked the surface layer. It seemed to Dan the only move was to make a hasty exit mid eruption

--------------------------
24.

incoming: 

gary: and second of all, NO. &nbsp;I didn't mess anything up. &nbsp;I was perfect on the phone
nick: beads of sweat form above his upper lip. &nbsp;The jury grew more alert with each implausible claim and nervous shift

lines: 

Right, &nbsp;APART FROM WHEN YOU TOLD THEM SHE WAS A STRIPPER?!?

--------------------------
25.

incoming: 

claire: Oh god Gary, did you call out Dan&nbsp;about the mess in the shower?
gary: &lt;whispers&gt;&nbsp;oh no, Claire don't do it

lines: 

&lt;nervous laugh&gt;&nbsp;hahah... what?

I didn't have diarhhea in the shower.. oh....

FINE I WAS TAKING A SHOWER AND I SNEEZED. Next thing I know, there are little splatters of brown stuff everywhere, and I thought 'did the face soap explode? &nbsp;I mean it was everywhere, on the wall, on the shower poofs, on the razor...

ending: I think we may just want to leave this one. &nbsp;Agreed?

--------------------------
26.

incoming: 

claire: Dan I just want to let you know that we're your friends and it's a safe space tell us anything,... like about girl trouble.... or digestive problems
gary: Let's change the subect back to me! &nbsp;Aren't I a tactless dick?! Let's get back to our other argument

lines: 

ummm... GARY TOLD THEM YOUR WERE A STRIPPER!

And would you look at the time? &nbsp;You guys should talk this out... &lt;runs upstairs&gt;

ending: And with that, Nick ran off, one would guess he was likely running to use the bathroom

--------------------------
27.

incoming: 

claire: Gary... please tell me you didn't tell them about my arrest

lines: 

what? when? &nbsp;what did you do?

ending: Oh Claire. &nbsp;They don't know what you did, but I do. &nbsp;Naughty girl....

--------------------------
28.

incoming: 

nick: A depth too deep for anyone to yet understand

lines: 

OK, Nick. Two can play at this game. &nbsp;'The strangest among them was so bored by their mindless quibbling, that he began to construct super structures of story to lay over their otherwise laborious common worries.'

<div>Each day he would wake up early just to write new plot points to integrate into the coming day. &nbsp;More excited about his creations than anything real</div>

Nick was slowly phasing out of &nbsp;existence

--------------------------
29.

incoming: 

gary: Anyways, at that point I was so drunk that I jumped up on the table&nbsp;and started stripping myself.&nbsp;

lines: 

wait what?

--------------------------
30.

incoming: 

gary: Claire had to basically tackle me off the table to stop me since everyone was taking video. &nbsp;I was a t-shirt away from being completely buck ass naked

lines: 

oh my god. &nbsp;I was completely wrong

ending: And so dear friends, whether you've found this first, or after a few tries, or after hundreds... you've finally reached the sweetest end to our tale.. &nbsp;But I supposed I don't know if this is actually the sweetest.. or the end.

--------------------------
31.

incoming: 

gary: by the way, thanks for ghosting my bachelor party,&nbsp;assholes.
nick: oh.. uuhhhh. &nbsp;yeah
claire: it was pretty weird you two&nbsp;weren't there

lines: 

... sorry about that&nbsp;dude

Crap. &nbsp;I think maybe I had it all wrong.... This is all my fault. &nbsp;I'm going upstairs.

ending: A bittersweet end. &nbsp;Dan realizes how far off his assumptions actually were. &nbsp;The healing can now begin

dan: Gary totally ruined your chances of getting that job!

lines: 

That's just not true! &nbsp;I helped her chances

Me and the interviewer got along great. &nbsp;I told them how driven and qualified you are and even got into a funny story that I think showed you from a different angle.

It was about.... ummm... that time at my bachelor party &lt;fakes like he just got a text&gt; &nbsp;oh crap! &nbsp;Tina, err.. Kristen is locked out of her place, GOTTA GO!

ending: Having in that moment realized the poor decision of sharing that story with the interviewer, Gary made a hasty exit. &nbsp;Hopefully by the time he returned, his roommates may have simply forgotten

claire: ohhhh Gary. &nbsp;You didn't tell them about your bachelor party gift.

lines: 

I... may have mentioned my bachelor party. &nbsp;But not in a bad way

I told them a story that clearly showed how great, willing and generous of a friend you are. &nbsp;And... It was the story of my bachelor party

It actually went really well! They sounded like they love you. &nbsp;I think you're going to get it!!!

ending: Was Gary actually this enthused and certain, or was he deflecting from something he didn't want the group to ask about?

--------------------------
5.

incoming: 

claire: NOT IN A BAD WAY?! &nbsp;YOU BROUGHT UP WHAT WE DID AT YOUR BACHELOR PARTY TO MY POTENTIAL EMPLOYER! &nbsp;THERE IS NO WAY 'NOT IN A BAD WAY'

WELL IF YOU GIVE ME A CHANCE I CAN TELL YOU!

--------------------------
6.

Uh oh

Yeah. anyway..... I didn't tell them you were a stripper

8.

incoming: 

claire: whoa whoa, why are you so upset?
dan: how could you do this to me man.. &nbsp;HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?!
dan: GARY TELL ME YOU DIDN'T MAKE CLAIRE STRIP FOR YOU AT YOUR BACHELOR PARTY!
claire: Dan! &nbsp;Gary didn't do anything. Relax

lines: 

Dan, just cool off man.&nbsp;

Claire didn't do anything. &nbsp;In reality, I had the most embarrassing time at my bachelor party

The actual stripper that we hired sprained her ankle literally right when she started&nbsp;dancing after Claire had spent like &nbsp;an hour showing her moves

by the way, thanks for ghosting my bachelor party,&nbsp;assholes.

Anyways, at that point I was so drunk that I jumped up on the table&nbsp;and started stripping myself.&nbsp;

Claire had to basically tackle me off the table to stop me since everyone was taking video. &nbsp;I was a t-shirt away from being completely buck ass naked

so...

ending: And so dear friends, whether you've found this first, or after a few tries, or after hundreds... you've finally reached the sweetest end to our tale.. &nbsp;But I supposed I don't know if this is actually the sweetest.. or the end.

10.

incoming: 

dan: DON'T TELL ME TO COOL OFF AFTER YOU F(*&amp;*ING SLEPT WITH&nbsp;THE GIRL YOU KNOW I'M IN LOVE WTH

--------------------------
11.

incoming: 

dan: <b>I can't believe you said that, man</b>
nick: A disturbing twist in the lives of 4 friends

lines: 

I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING LIKE THAT!! &nbsp;If anything, I helped her chances of getting the job

There's a reason Claire put me down as her reference and not you, Dan

It's because I can grasp complex concepts and express them in a nuanced but understandable way

ending: The room groaned in unison. &nbsp;Certainly Gary has redeeming qualities, but humility is not one of them.

--------------------------
12.

incoming: 

nick: Our antagonist&nbsp;turns to the camera and jeers at the audience

lines: 

Nick, you are literally the weirdest person any of us know

dan: you.... blackmailed her?

Alright, you know what, Dan? &nbsp;If you're jealous, that's fine

lines: 

hahah. &nbsp;I get it. &nbsp; 'But the more he weaved his own intricate latice work to lay upon the concrete reality, the less he could tell the difference between the two'

he began to construct a space craft to orbit the earth. &nbsp;Then would he truly be able to narrate from above

gary: Claire didn't do anything. &nbsp;In reality, I had the most embarrassing time at my bachelor party
dan: what the hell are you talking about now?

lines: 

AHAHAHAHAHA... &nbsp;I TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT THAT!

Man, that night started alot different than it finished. &nbsp;Gary was the only one who actually ended up taking off any clothes.&nbsp;Dan I think you should calm down on Gary. &nbsp;He actually did help me. &nbsp;I GOT THE JOB!!!

ending: And so dear friends, whether you've found this first, or after a few tries, or after hundreds... you've finally reached the sweetest end to our tale.. &nbsp;But I supposed I don't know if this is actually the sweetest.. or the end.

dan: no Gary. &nbsp;You took a big fat steaming crap on her chances
gary: I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING LIKE THAT!! &nbsp;If anything, I helped her chances of getting the job
nick: A bold claim in defense. &nbsp;Knight takes pawn

lines: 

You got the call today?... Gary... what did you say?

GARY, WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

Gary... please tell me you didn't tell them about my arrest

--------------------------
16.

incoming: 

gary: There's a reason Claire put me down as her reference and not you, Dan
dan: it's because you asked her to?
nick: The audience stops for a moment to consider, and quickly realizes he probably asked her to

lines: 

It's because he asked me to

It was very sweet, &nbsp;in a Gary sort of way..

and although giving Gary shit is a supremely enjoyable pastime, I should tell you guys that maybe what Gary said DID help.... &nbsp;BECAUSE I GOT THE JOOOOB MOTHER F%*^&amp;%!!!! &nbsp; DRINKS ON ME!!&nbsp;

ending: The foot is on the other shoe, says Claire. &nbsp;All this exchange now appears to have been and exercise, or an experiment

--------------------------
17.

incoming: 

gary: I didn't ask her to!

lines: 

Sure you did. Two weeks&nbsp;ago at Thirsty Crow, You said 'It would be a mistake to not put me down as a reference'&nbsp;

For you, that's like getting on your knees and kissing my toes

--------------------------
18.

incoming: 

gary: That&nbsp;hardly sounds like&nbsp;asking

lines: 

FOR A NORMAL PERSON! &nbsp;But for you that was like falling to the ground and kissing my toes

--------------------------
19.

incoming: 

dan: I think i'm gonna puke
gary: No, Dan. &nbsp;I injected my seed&nbsp;into her chances to let them grow greater...&nbsp;
nick: You, the viewer, must now live with that waking nightmare every time you close your eyes.

lines: 

super gross

I just... I can't...

--------------------------
20.

incoming: 

nick: Our antagonist&nbsp;turns to the camera and jeers at the audience
gary: Shut up Nick

Nick you're not helping

--------------------------
21.

incoming: 

dan: hahaha. &nbsp;Maybe Nick brings up a good point. Maybe Gary is some sort of a dark character in a psychological thriller

lines: 

DAN! &nbsp;Stop piling on Gary

NICK&nbsp;PLEASE&nbsp;STOP!

--------------------------
23.

incoming: 

nick: oooooohhhhhhhhh
dan: ....Did you drug her?
dan: oh wait no. &nbsp;it's because you physically threatened her
dan: And you're a narcissist. AND you're not as smart as you think you are&nbsp;
nick: The conversation twisted and turned into the thickening brambles&nbsp;
gary: You're a real piece of s*&amp;%t
dan: you.... blackmailed her?
dan: Gary.... There are no bounds to your delusions

lines: 

sheesh you guys are really mean to each other

ending: The foot is on the other shoe, says Claire. &nbsp;All this exchange now appears to have been and exercise, or an experiment

--------------------------
24.

incoming: 

gary: It's because she thinks highly of my opinion

lines: 

Ohhh Gary... I think you're very nice, but that's not why

25.

incoming: 

gary: I think i know what it is. &nbsp;It's embarrassing to say, but I think Dan is in love with me

lines: 

&lt;confused&gt;

ending: That last part didn't really seem related to anything. &nbsp;I fear this portion of the writing happened later into the evening

--------------------------
26.

incoming: 

nick: Ahhh, the charming insult. Claire had grown skilled in this

lines: 

F*&amp;^K YOU NICK, YOU F*&amp;^ING THEATER NERD. &nbsp;Start talking to people instead of being their audience. &nbsp;Stop your course down the road to becoming a serial killer

&lt;steaming&gt;

ending: Quick question viewer. &nbsp;Do you think I'm the voice inside your head? &nbsp;Or am I just an impartial abstract narrator being?... oorrrrrr, am I Nick in the future, telling stories from across the glass in jail...

--------------------------
27.

incoming: 

dan: Ok, now&nbsp;I'm definitely going to puke
gary: that sounded different in my head. My point was that what I have to offer is what Claire needed to get&nbsp;over the edge

lines: 

Ok. &nbsp;I think that's it for me guys. &nbsp;Gary, I'm locking my door tonight with the dead bolt. &nbsp;Just thought you should know

ending: Gary does what Gary does. And he does it so well, he usually doesn't even realize it

--------------------------
28.

incoming: 

dan: She'll end up spiraling into an labyrinth of depression!

lines: 

Oh my god!&nbsp;How will I ever survive!? &nbsp;Relax Dan

And Gary, please tell me you didn't get creative on that call and throw in a few 'Gary-isms'

ohhhh Gary. &nbsp;You didn't tell them about your bachelor party gift.

PLEASE SAY YOU DIDN'T TELL THEM THAT GARY!!!!

JK! I don't care! &nbsp;They called an hour ago and said I got the job. &nbsp;Gary they said you were super nervous, but said nice things...... &nbsp; SUCKAS! &nbsp;DRINKS ON ME TONIGHT!

--------------------------
31.

incoming: 

nick: ever the silent critic,&nbsp;Claire finally speaks up. She is woman, hear her roar
nick: beads of sweat form above his upper lip. &nbsp;The jury grew more alert with each implausible claim and nervous shift

lines: 

NICK!!&nbsp;I AM THIS CLOSE TO STRANGLING YOU!!

god,&nbsp;this is getting totally out of hand. &nbsp;guys. &nbsp;Forget about this whole thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm going upstairs. &nbsp;Gary, If you said something you shouldn't have to them.... I'm going to kill you in your sleep.&nbsp;

ending: Little did the other roommates know, but this would be a significant moment. &nbsp;Claire went upstairs. &nbsp;Realized how far apart they'd grown, packed up her things and moved out that very night

--------------------------
32.

incoming: 

gary: OK, what am I missing here? Claire, are you prevented, by law, from applying for any other job except for this one?

lines: 

I am prevented by my gender from applying for more than 2 jobs in a calendar year. It's a real raw deal

And Gary, please tell me you didn't get creative on that call and throw in a few 'Gary-isms'

ohhhh Gary. &nbsp;You didn't tell them about your bachelor party gift.

34.

incoming: 

dan: OK, Nick. Two can play at this game. &nbsp;'The strangest among them was so bored by their mindless quibbling, that he began to construct super structures of story to lay over their otherwise laborious common worries.'

lines: 

He began to think of the people he interacted with more like action figures than people

'until one day, his mind had been so focused on adding narrative embellishment to the world around him, that he forgot to live in it. &nbsp;And then he became Nick: A passenger and narrator to his own life'

--------------------------
35.

incoming: 

gary: I told them a story that clearly showed how great, willing and generous of a friend you are. &nbsp;And... It was the story of my bachelor party

lines: 

I CAN'T F*&amp;^*&amp;% BELIEVE YOU!! &nbsp;WHAT IN THE WORLD WOULD MAKE YOU THINK THAT WAS ALRIGHT?!?!?

ending: ahhhh, but there in lies the rub. &nbsp;Gary did not think, therefore he couldn't answer this question

--------------------------
36.

incoming: 

dan: this should be good
nick: The group eagerly awaited

lines: 

Go ahead

--------------------------
37.

incoming: 

gary: Claire had to basically tackle me off the table to stop me since everyone was taking video. &nbsp;I was a t-shirt away from being completely buck ass naked

lines: 

it was a memorable night

ending: And so dear friends, whether you've found this first, or after a few tries, or after hundreds... you've finally reached the sweetest end to our tale.. &nbsp;But I supposed I don't know if this is actually the sweetest.. or the end.

--------------------------
38.

incoming: 

gary: by the way, thanks for ghosting my bachelor party,&nbsp;assholes.
gary: The actual stripper that we hired sprained her ankle literally right when she started&nbsp;dancing after Claire had spent like &nbsp;an hour showing her moves

lines: 

it was pretty weird you two&nbsp;weren't there

Man, that night started alot different than it finished. &nbsp;Gary was the only one who actually ended up taking off any clothes.&nbsp;Dan I think you should calm down on Gary. &nbsp;He actually did help me. &nbsp;I GOT THE JOB!!!
